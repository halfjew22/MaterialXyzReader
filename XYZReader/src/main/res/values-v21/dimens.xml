    <!--In the design support library, as of 8/21/15, the FAB renders its
        shadow on API < 21. This causes problems with padding because
        internally, the shadow is seen as "part" of the view, so it
        will include it when making decisions about layout. To account
        for this, we include different FAB margins for pre and post
        Lollipop.-->
